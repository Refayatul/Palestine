            <p>This period focuses on the ongoing events in Palestine, particularly the intensified Israeli offensive on Gaza, the escalating humanitarian crisis, and international efforts for accountability.</p>

            <h2>2023 Gaza War and Genocide Allegations</h2>
            <p>Following Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks, Israel launched an intensive offensive on Gaza, leading to unprecedented levels of destruction, casualties, and widespread accusations of genocide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2023 Gaza War (Oct 2023–Jan 2025):</strong> After Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks, Israel launched an intensive 15 month offensive on Gaza. UN monitoring groups report roughly 47,000 Palestinians killed (about 70% women and children) and 111,000 wounded, with nearly 70% of Gaza’s infrastructure destroyed [Source: UN](). The UN’s Independent Commission of Inquiry (Oct. 2024) concluded Israel has employed a “concerted policy to destroy Gaza’s healthcare system” and deliberately targeted civilians, doctors, hospitals, even UN shelters [Source: UN]() [Source: UN](). It found Israeli forces committed war crimes and the crime against humanity of “extermination” through relentless attacks on medical workers and beds [Source: UN]() [Source: UN](). The report detailed multiple strikes that killed entire families, ambulances and babies, and documented torture and killings of Palestinian detainees. Thousands of Palestinians (including children) held in Israeli custody were found to have been systematically beaten, sexualized and deprived of food – acts the Commission classifies as war crimes and crimes against humanity (torture, rape) [Source: UN](). In sum, the Inquiry determined Israeli forces committed repeated atrocities – intentional attacks on non-combatants, starvation as warfare, sexual violence, and forced transfers – that violate the Geneva Conventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Humanitarian Catastrophe:</strong> The war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread displacement, famine, and the collapse of healthcare and essential services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Accountability Efforts and International Response</h2>
            <p>The scale of the violence and alleged atrocities has prompted significant international legal and political responses, including cases at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accountability Efforts:</strong> International bodies have responded. In July 2023 the UN’s top court (ICJ) ordered Israel to halt actions “within the scope of genocide” – orders Israel has largely ignored. The International Criminal Court opened a full investigation in 2021 into all parties, and on 21 Nov. 2024 the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant, charging them with war crimes (using starvation as a method, intentionally attacking civilians) and crimes against humanity (murder, persecution, etc.) during the Gaza onslaught [Source: ICC](). Human Rights Watch and Amnesty have repeatedly urged Israel to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the killings, instead of granting immunity [Source: HRW]() [Source: Amnesty]().</li>
                <li><strong>Global Protests and Solidarity:</strong> The ongoing events have sparked massive global protests and solidarity movements, demanding a ceasefire, an end to the occupation, and justice for Palestinians.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Over decades, reports from the UN, ICC, and leading NGOs paint a consistent picture: Israeli military and state actors have carried out large-scale violations of international law against Palestinians, from the 1948 expulsion to recent Gaza campaigns. These include forcible displacement, indiscriminate bombing of civilians, torture of detainees, and other abuses that rights groups call war crimes and crimes against humanity [Source: Amnesty]() Source: UN. Despite clear documentation by independent sources, accountability has been almost entirely lacking. The ICC’s recent indictment of Israeli leaders and numerous UN resolutions underscore mounting demands for justice. In summary, the chronicle of abuses by Israeli forces reflects a sustained pattern of atrocities against Palestinians – for which activists and legal experts insist there must finally be impartial investigations and accountability Source: ICC Source: HRW.</p>
            <p>Sources: Authoritative investigations by the UN (Special Rapporteurs, Commissions of Inquiry), Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other NGOs, as well as ICC and international legal analyses Source: Amnesty Source: UN Source: ICC Source: HRW. Each cited finding above is drawn directly from these primary reports.</p>
