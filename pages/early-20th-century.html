            <h1>Early 20th Century Palestine (1900-1947)</h1>
            <p>This period covers Palestine under Ottoman rule, the British Mandate, increasing Zionist immigration, and the early forms of Palestinian resistance against colonization.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="period-content">
            <h2>Ottoman Rule and Early Zionist Influx (1900-1917)</h2>
            <p>At the turn of the 20th century, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, a diverse region with a predominantly Arab Muslim and Christian population, alongside a small Jewish community. The land was fertile, and its people were deeply connected to their agricultural heritage and religious sites.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Late Ottoman Period:</strong> Palestine was administratively part of the Ottoman Empire, divided into several sanjaks (districts). The population was largely rural, with urban centers like Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, and Gaza thriving as cultural and economic hubs.</li>
                <li><strong>Rise of Zionism:</strong> Towards the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th, the Zionist movement gained momentum in Europe, advocating for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This led to waves of Jewish immigration (Aliyahs) and land purchases, often from absentee landlords, displacing Palestinian farmers.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Palestinian Resistance:</strong> Palestinians began to voice concerns and organize against Zionist land acquisition and political aspirations, seeing it as a threat to their national identity and existence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The British Mandate (1917-1947)</h2>
            <p>Following World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and Palestine came under British control through a League of Nations Mandate. This period was marked by British policies that facilitated Zionist aims, leading to increased tensions and conflict.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balfour Declaration (1917):</strong> A pivotal moment, this declaration by the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour expressed British support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," while vaguely safeguarding the rights of "existing non-Jewish communities." This was seen by Palestinians as a betrayal and a colonial imposition.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Immigration:</strong> Under the Mandate, Jewish immigration to Palestine significantly increased, leading to demographic shifts and heightened competition for land and resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Palestinian Revolts:</strong> Palestinians launched several revolts and protests against British policies and Zionist expansion, including the 1929 Buraq Uprising and the 1936-1939 Great Arab Revolt. These uprisings were brutally suppressed by British forces, often with Zionist paramilitary assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Peel Commission (1937):</strong> The British Peel Commission proposed partitioning Palestine, allocating 33% of the land to Jewish settlers (who were 30% of the population and owned 6% of the land) and 67% to Palestinian Arabs. It also suggested the forced transfer of 225,000 Palestinians. This plan was rejected by Palestinians.</li>
                <li><strong>White Papers:</strong> British policy shifted at times, with White Papers attempting to limit Jewish immigration, but these were often influenced by international pressures and the escalating conflict.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Towards the Catastrophe (1947)</h2>
            <p>As the British Mandate drew to a close, the international community, particularly the newly formed United Nations, stepped in to determine Palestine's future, leading to a plan that would ignite the Nakba.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UN Partition Plan (Resolution 181, 1947):</strong> The UN General Assembly voted to partition Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem as an international city. This plan awarded 55% of Palestine to a Jewish state despite Jews owning only 7% of the land and being 33% of the population. Palestinians overwhelmingly rejected the plan as illegitimate and unjust.</li>
                <li><strong>Escalating Violence:</strong> The period immediately preceding the end of the Mandate saw escalating violence between Zionist militias and Palestinian communities, laying the groundwork for the 1948 war.</li>
            </ul>
