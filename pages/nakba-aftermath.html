            <h2>The Nakba (1948): Ethnic Cleansing and Displacement</h2>
            <p>The 1948 war, which led to the creation of the State of Israel, was a catastrophe for Palestinians, resulting in mass expulsions, destruction of villages, and the creation of a refugee crisis that continues to this day.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mass Expulsion:</strong> In the war surrounding Israel’s creation, Israeli forces expelled roughly 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and destroyed over 400 villages [Source: B’Tselem](). Survivors were prevented from returning by discriminatory laws, and became refugees. Human rights analysts describe the 1948 expulsions as ethnic cleansing and note that Israel’s laws enshrined a system of racial discrimination (apartheid) against remaining Palestinians [Source: HRW]() Source: UN. These mass expulsions and destruction of civilian villages violated the Hague and Geneva Conventions (prohibiting forced transfer of protected persons) and are now widely regarded as crimes against humanity.</li>
                <li><strong>Massacres:</strong> Over 70 massacres were committed by Zionist militias during the Nakba, including Deir Yassin and Tantura, designed to terrorize and drive out the Palestinian population.</li>
                <li><strong>Refugee Crisis:</strong> Millions of Palestinians became refugees, either internally displaced or forced into neighboring countries, denied their right of return by Israel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Early Occupation and Military Rule (1948-1967)</h2>
            <p>Following the 1948 war, Israel established control over 78% of historic Palestine. Palestinians who remained within the newly formed state were subjected to military rule, land confiscation, and discriminatory laws.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Military Rule within Israel:</strong> Palestinian citizens of Israel were placed under prolonged military rule (until 1966) and denied full rights. Many lost land and livelihoods. Rights groups note that Israeli policies during this period (land confiscation, residency revocations, oppressive military orders) were part of an overarching strategy of domination that international observers call apartheid and persecution Source: UN Source: UN.</li>
                <li><strong>Continued Expulsions and Raids:</strong> In the early state period, Israeli forces also carried out punitive raids and village destructions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza (held by Jordan and Egypt until 1967). For example, in 1956 Israeli commandoes attacked Palestinian villages in the Jordan Valley, killing dozens. (Israel’s 1956 Sinai War also involved heavy civilian casualties in Gaza.) These actions involved indiscriminate fire on civilians and destruction of property, violating laws of war and amounting to war crimes by today’s standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Land Confiscation:</strong> Israel enacted a series of laws, such as the Absentees' Property Law, to legalize the confiscation of Palestinian land and property, which was then used for Jewish settlement and development.</li>
            </ul>
