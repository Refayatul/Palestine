            <h1>Occupation and Intifadas (1967-2000)</h1>
            <p>This period covers the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem following the 1967 war, the expansion of illegal settlements, and the two major Palestinian uprisings (Intifadas) against occupation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="period-content">
            <h2>The 1967 War and Immediate Occupation (Naksa)</h2>
            <p>The Six-Day War in June 1967 resulted in Israel occupying the remaining Palestinian territories, marking a new phase of military control and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more Palestinians.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Six-Day War (1967):</strong> Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. It immediately imposed military occupation on millions of Palestinians. Within weeks it began appropriating land and housing for new Jewish settlements, in contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Amnesty International emphasizes that the very existence of these settlements “violates international humanitarian law and is a war crime” [Source: Amnesty](). Over the following decades Israel confiscated tens of thousands of hectares, demolished homes to make way for settlers, and barred Palestinians from their lands [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: Amnesty]().</li>
                <li><strong>New Refugee Wave:</strong> An additional 300,000 Palestinians were displaced during and after the 1967 war, becoming refugees for a second time (Naksa - "setback").</li>
                <li><strong>Military Administration:</strong> Israel established a military administration in the occupied territories, imposing strict controls on Palestinian life, movement, and resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Settlement Expansion and Land Confiscation</h2>
            <p>Following 1967, Israel systematically expanded its illegal settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, seizing vast tracts of Palestinian land and creating a dual legal system that favored settlers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Settlement Expansion:</strong> By 1987 Israel supported over 300,000 settlers in the West Bank and Gaza [Source: Amnesty](). Human Rights Watch and others note that settlement-building – which involves transferring Israeli civilians onto occupied territory and seizing Palestinian property – meets the Rome Statute’s definition of a war crime [Source: HRW]() [Source: Amnesty](). In practice, settlers often used violence to drive out Palestinians; Israeli forces typically failed to protect civilians. (For instance, during the 1980s wave of settlement construction, entire Palestinian hamlets were uprooted.)</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Extensive infrastructure, including bypass roads and water networks, was built to serve the settlements, further fragmenting Palestinian land and restricting Palestinian movement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The First Intifada (1987-1993)</h2>
            <p>A spontaneous popular uprising against the Israeli occupation, the First Intifada was characterized by widespread civil disobedience and non-violent resistance, met with brutal repression by Israeli forces.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Intifada (1987–1993):</strong> Palestinian uprising met with brutal Israeli response. Human Rights Watch documented that from late 1987 to early 1990 Israeli forces killed over 670 Palestinians (many unarmed) and wounded thousands more [Source: HRW](). IDF rules of engagement allowed live fire against stone-throwers, resulting in routine use of lethal force against non-violent demonstrators. HRW reported systematic rights violations: injuries and deaths from live ammunition, beatings, torture in detention, and punitive measures (mass curfews, home demolitions) [Source: HRW]() Source: UN. Many of these acts – deliberately targeting civilians without threat and collective punishment – flagrantly violated international humanitarian law. The brutality was widely condemned as constituting war crimes (e.g. willful killings of protesters) and crimes against humanity (persecution of a civilian population under occupation) [Source: HRW]() Source: UN.</li>
                <li><strong>Civilian Killings and Demolitions:</strong> Throughout the Intifada Israel imposed harsh measures: firing on refugee camp rallies, bulldozing houses of suspected attackers, and shooting patients at checkpoints. For example, on March 31, 1988, Israeli forces surrounded the Birzeit University dormitory (defended only by unarmed students) and shot 30 Palestinians as they surrendered. Such incidents of firing on unarmed Palestinians were documented by [Source: Amnesty]() and Source: UN as grave breaches of the laws of war.</li>
                <li><strong>Sabra-Shatila Massacre (1982):</strong> Although preceding the First Intifada, the Sabra-Shatila massacre in Lebanon (1982) remains a critical event of this broader period, highlighting Israeli indirect responsibility for atrocities against Palestinians. During Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces allowed allied Christian militias into the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. The militias massacred an estimated 2,000–3,500 Palestinian and Lebanese civilians. Video and testimonies confirm Israeli tanks encircling the camps and shooting at civilians trying to flee Source: UN. The UN General Assembly deemed this slaughter a “massacre” and investigators found Israeli troops withheld water and light for the victims. While the direct killings were by the militia, Israel’s facilitation (blockading exits and turning flares on by night) makes this a grievous war crime for which Israeli officials bear indirect responsibility Source: UN.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Oslo Accords and Their Aftermath (1993-2000)</h2>
            <p>The Oslo Accords were a series of agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), intended to lead to a peaceful resolution, but ultimately failed to end the occupation or establish a sovereign Palestinian state.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Self-Rule:</strong> The accords established the Palestinian Authority (PA) with limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza, but Israel retained overall control over borders, airspace, and significant portions of land.</li>
                <li><strong>Continued Settlement Growth:</strong> Despite the peace process, Israeli settlement construction continued and even accelerated, undermining the possibility of a viable Palestinian state.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Dependency:</strong> The accords created a system of economic dependency, with Israel controlling Palestinian trade and movement, hindering Palestinian economic development.</li>
            </ul>
