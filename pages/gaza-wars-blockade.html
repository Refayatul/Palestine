            <h1>Gaza Wars and Ongoing Blockade (2000-2023)</h1>
            <p>This period details the Second Intifada, the devastating Israeli blockade of Gaza, and the series of major military assaults on the Gaza Strip, resulting in widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="period-content">
            <h2>The Second Intifada (2000-2005)</h2>
            <p>A renewed Palestinian uprising, triggered by Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to Al-Aqsa Mosque, led to intense combat and severe Israeli repression across the occupied territories.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Second Intifada (2000–2005):</strong> A renewed uprising led to intense combat. Notably, in April 2002 the IDF stormed the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank under “Operation Defensive Shield.” Human Rights Watch and other observers found extensive evidence of war crimes in Jenin: summary executions of unarmed residents, torture of detainees, and wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure [Source: HRW]() [Source: HRW](). Over 50 Palestinians were killed there (many civilians), and hospitals, mosques, and hundreds of homes were demolished with no military necessity. HRW explicitly urged Israeli authorities to launch criminal investigations of individual commanders for these abuses [Source: HRW]().</li>
                <li><strong>Construction of the Apartheid Wall:</strong> Israel began constructing the Separation Wall/Apartheid Wall in the West Bank, annexing Palestinian land and further restricting movement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Gaza Blockade (2007-Present)</h2>
            <p>Following Hamas's electoral victory in Gaza, Israel imposed a comprehensive land, air, and sea blockade, turning the Strip into an "open-air prison" and creating a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gaza Blockade (2007–2023):</strong> After Hamas took Gaza in 2007, Israel imposed a land-air-sea blockade. The United Nations and ICRC call the blockade “collective punishment” of Gaza’s 2 million people Source: UN [Source: ICRC](). It has choked fuel, electricity, food and medicine into Gaza, contributing to humanitarian crisis and death. International experts argue that imposing starvation or denial of aid on civilians in an occupied territory amounts to a war crime. (Indeed, Israel’s recent ICC indictment charges its leaders with “starvation of civilians as a method of warfare” in Gaza [Source: ICC]()).</li>
                <li><strong>Humanitarian Crisis:</strong> The blockade has led to chronic shortages of essential goods, collapse of infrastructure, and a dire economic situation, with high rates of poverty and unemployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Major Israeli Military Operations on Gaza</h2>
            <p>Between 2008 and 2023, Israel launched several large-scale military assaults on the densely populated Gaza Strip, resulting in thousands of Palestinian casualties, overwhelmingly civilians, and massive destruction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operation Cast Lead (2008–2009):</strong> In this 3 week Gaza war, IDF operations killed about 1,400 Palestinians (including ~300 children) [Source: Amnesty](). Amnesty documented that Israeli forces used heavy aerial bombardment and tank fire on densely populated neighborhoods. They bombed homes and UN schools without warning, even while children slept inside, violating the principles of distinction and proportionality [Source: Amnesty](). Witnesses described bombardments that flattened entire families. Analysts noted that the scale of civilian death and destruction indicated systematic disregard for civilian life. Both the UN and rights groups concluded that many attacks were indiscriminate or disproportionate, amounting to war crimes [Source: Amnesty]() Source: UN.</li>
                <li><strong>Gaza War 2014 (Operation Protective Edge):</strong> Over 50 days of fighting killed more than 2,000 Palestinians (around 550 children) Source: UN and wounded over 10,000. Amnesty UK reported extensive evidence of unlawful strikes: many homes were hit directly without prior warning, and in some cases hospitals and mosques were bombed [Source: Amnesty](). Even Israel’s deputy leader Nick Clegg called the bombardment “deliberately disproportionate” and “collective punishment” Source: UN. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty found credible allegations that Israeli forces carried out airstrikes that ravaged entire civilian apartment blocks far from any military targets – acts that would constitute war crimes Source: UN [Source: Amnesty]().</li>
                <li><strong>Great March of Return (2018–2019):</strong> Weekly Gaza protests demanding end to the siege were met by Israeli snipers. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty documented that at least 186 Palestinians (including over 40 children) were shot dead by Israeli forces in these demonstrations. On 14 May 2018 alone, 59 unarmed protesters were killed by live fire [Source: UN]() [Source: Amnesty](). Medics and journalists were also shot. Such use of lethal force against largely peaceful demonstrators (throwing stones or tires only) violated the rules of engagement; investigators have said many of these killings appear unlawful.</li>
                <li><strong>Settler Violence and Forced Displacement:</strong> Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Jewish settler militias (often backed by the army) attacked Palestinian villagers in the West Bank, burning homes and orchards. In several incidents (e.g. Duma, 2015), extremists murdered Palestinian children. Israel’s failure to stop or prosecute these acts (often planting soldiers nearby) effectively made the state an accomplice. Amnesty warns this violence is part of a “state-backed campaign” of dispossession under apartheid [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: HRW](). Each new settlement or eviction (like in East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah district) involves forcible transfer of Palestinians – an act international law deems a war crime. (As UN special rapporteurs have noted, the evictions violate rights to housing and could amount to forcible displacement [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: HRW]()).</li>
