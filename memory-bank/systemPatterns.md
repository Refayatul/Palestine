# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The system architecture is a website consisting of multiple HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files. The website is designed to be a comprehensive and informative resource about the history of Palestine.

## Key Technical Decisions

-   Using HTML for structuring the content of the website.
-   Using CSS for styling the website and ensuring a consistent look and feel.
-   Using JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic features to the website.

## Design Patterns in Use

-   **Timeline Pattern:** A timeline is used to visualize key events in Palestinian history.
-   **Modular CSS:** CSS is organized into separate files for different sections of the website to improve maintainability.
-   **JavaScript Modules:** JavaScript code is organized into modules to promote code reuse and prevent naming conflicts.

## Component Relationships

-   HTML pages are linked together using hyperlinks.
-   CSS stylesheets are linked to HTML pages using the `<link>` tag.
-   JavaScript files are linked to HTML pages using the `<script>` tag.

## Critical Implementation Paths

-   Loading and rendering the timeline on the history page.
-   Navigating between different historical periods using the navigation menu.
-   Displaying images and other multimedia content on the website.
