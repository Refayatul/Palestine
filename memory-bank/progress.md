## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   The decision to use a memory bank was made to ensure consistency and maintain context across development sessions.
-   The decision to host the project on Cloudflare free static site hosting has influenced the technical constraints and implementation choices.
-   The decision to create individual HTML pages for each timeline event was made to provide more detailed information and improve the user experience.
-   The decision to revert the changes to index.html and then re-implement the changes in a more careful and incremental way was made to address the user's feedback and ensure that the changes met their requirements.
